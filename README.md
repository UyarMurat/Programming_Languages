# Programming_Languages
Repository for Different Programming Languages like C/C++, Python, C#

I would like to make programming more accessible to students/learners in the form of smaller projects divided into sections that teach the essential basics.

In addition, I would like to add cheat sheets for each programming language, for topics that not everyone can memorize. I want to make this as comprehensive as possible so that everyone can use it.

I myself have been programming for a long time and even I forget things from time to time, so if someone should forget something on a topic, you can access it at any time.
